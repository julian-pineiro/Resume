# Github Resume
Brief walk through some of my projects, technologies I used, and evolution as a professional.

## Presentation
Hello, my name is Julian Pi√±eiro. I'm an information systems engineering student, and my goal is to get my BA degree around december 2022.
I was born in Argentina and partially raised in FL, USA (This is why my english accent sounds southern).

#### Languages
I am fluent in both spanish and english (both spoken and written). I also know some italian (intermediate level) and german (just the basics).

#### Residency, Citizenship and Work Permits
As both an argentinian and an italian citizen, I can legally work for companies based in the European Union as well as Argentina. I can also work via contract for any company, but it may require some additional paperwork as a W8-BEN form to work for the USA.

#### What I like and what I do
I am into business, management and I'm an unquiet entrepreneur. I like to see the results of my work so I will go the extra mile for a client every time it's within my reach. 
To both build my interpersonal skills and upselling experience, I found a nice hobby in bartending in my younger years. The last job I had in this industry was at Vail, CO in a four-diamond resort bar.
I currently own a third-party Apple repair shop which I do for fun and also some side income. It is managed by myself and it has grown via Instagram to be the more advanced shop in the area. We are a team of 3 technicians lead by me. We do microsoldering and sometimes even some research, and it's growing at a rate of 30-50% annually without paid advertising. I'm also in charge of treasury, social media, logistics (I purchase personally from China and USA suppliers). You can follow us on Instagram, our handle is @icare.bahiablanca.

## Software career
Let's speak about what's relevant and why you're on GitHub, right?
The order and years below may be wrong for the older projects I'm less proud of.
The idea behind this is to present a timeline of technologies I explored. 
Just starting 2020 I believe I started doing higher quality projects and code.

### University Projects and Technologies

**2021 
UpTail - PHP (Laravel)**

Backend App for my Web Applications Engineering course. This was an app meant to let an user publish a cocktail recipe and vote others. This is the backend part, and it may still be stored at www.uptail-iaw.herokuapp.com
 
**UpTail API - Javascript (Node/Express)**

This is an API for the previous project, for the front-end project to interact with its stored information. It may still be stored at www.uptail-api.herokuapp.com/

**UpTail FrontEnd - Javascript/JSX (React.js)**

This is the front-end for Uptail. Because of deadlines in the semester, this project ended up being just a recipe presentation and suggestion page, and didn't reach its final scope. it may still be stored at www.uptail-js.herokuapp.com

**Refactoring SongRepository - Kotlin**

This is a project in Kotlin for Software Architecture and Design course. Throughout the semester, the goal was to work in a team of 4 people to refactor a badly coded but functional application, add functionality to it, and make it comply with SOLID principles, dependency injection and inversion, Clean Code standards, GOF design patterns and architectural patterns.
I feel this was the more influential course in my career so far.

**2020
ParkingMeters - Java**

Database course project meant to explore every aspect of SQL database concepts.

**Algorithms and Complexity Investigation Projects - Python 3 (Jupyter Notebooks)**

In this subject we made about 9 paper-like investigation with test batteries and optimization practice for algoritmia and complexity analysis. I don't have these but I may be able to find them on the university platform by request.

**2019
Galaxian - Java**

This is was a project for the same Programming Technology course. It was a clone of the Space Invaders game, using design patterns such as Visitor for the shots, State for the PowerUps, Strategy for the enemies movement, and some more I frankly can't remember. It was my first collaborative project using Git/Github and it was developed by me and two more friends. Sadly I don't keep a copy of this project at hand, but can look it up by request.

**IntoDeBrich - Java**

Similar to the previous game, this was a knockoff Into The Breach developed by myself. The code is kept private but it may be accessed by request.

**MedicosBahia - GWT (deprecated)**

This is a small search engine using the Google Web Toolkit, an abandoned framework that Google killed to develop what's now known as Dart.
This was used as a final project for my Programming Technology course, which was about learning and implementing SOLID Principles and GOF design patterns to achieve extendable, mantainable code.
I personally disliked this project because the framework was already unsupported and I had a ton of issues using it.

**Logic Programming Practice - Prolog/LISP**

This is a logical programming language I used in my Logic course. I have a full repository with solved practice exercises in these languages. Access can be granted by request.

### Side Projects

**2021
Turnos iCare - Javascript Frontend (Vue.js 2.0)**

This is the front-end of a project I need implemented to optimize my repair business. It is meant to replace a Google Form for a smarter alternative, faster and with a layer of logic that self-assigns appointments to the customer. Its scope may change in the future to implement some other functionality. May be hosted at www.turnos-vue.herokuapp.com

**iCare Backend - Javascript Backend (Node.js/Express/MongoDB)**

This is a current project I'm developing, meant to be released soon. It's the logic behind the front end app for iCare. It uses a No-SQL database because requirements may change a lot in this business.

2020 was a busy year in university and I didn't develop much, at least mention-worthy stuff.

**2019
StockKeeping/Blog - Python 3.x (Django)**

This was a project I made using the Django Web Framework for Python 3. It was made alongside a 30-something hour web course meant to develop a Blog, but I gave it a twist to make a stock keeping app.

**Backend REST API - C# (Nancy FX 2.0)**

Simple CRUD app made with NancyFX framework for C#.

**QRHashInvites 1.1 - Python 3.x**

This is a monolytic script I built for a college party looking to email some invitation for a party, generating a random color invitation and sending it via SMTP protocol (aka email). I keep this code private, you can request access via email. It's one of my first coding projects.

**Domotics project - Python (bad technology selected IMO)**

This was a domotics project made with Python 3 to run on raspberry pi 3 distributed in a field, using a Sense-Compute-Control-like architecture. Configurations were done via GUI with Tkinter.
